This is the repository for the RJIT Aviation Club's (R.A.C) Github pages website.

Until I.N.T can source a PC to host our own website, this repo will stay public as we are using Github pages for free.

There is no custom domain name yet (not priority + broke). So we will have to use the domain github gives us. We name it whatever, but "github" will keep showing up. 

If you are reading this, chances are you are a R.A.C Member. If you want to learn more or have any suggestions then please contact the Club President or the provisional internal website team.

Happy flying!
